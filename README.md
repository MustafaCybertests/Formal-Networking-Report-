<h2>Description</h2>
For my Intro to Networking class final exam, I had to write a formal report to a company's executives giving my recommendations on how to structure their IT Network. The Intro to Networking course covered a broud number of topics, those topics including, networking basics, TCP/IP protocol suites, wireless and wide area networks, network security, and troubleshooting. This final exam tasked me with compiling everything I learned and give recommendations on structuring a IT Network.

<h2>Final Example and Rubric </h2>
Imagine that you have been asked by Greenfield Properties to provide guidance and advice about how they should set up the IT network in their new building. Review the scenario and client requirements about Greenfield Properties again if needed, including the various job roles and devices to be supported.

Your assignment is to write a formal report to the company’s executives mentioning your recommendations.

Since your target audience is not highly technical, you will need to explain technical features and their importance in simple terms. Do not use a lot of jargon that they will not understand; if you do use jargon, you must explain each term.

Your report should focus on benefits and drawbacks and show an awareness of what the company’s decision-makers want as the end result of this network rollout. In other words, you should focus on what their overall goals are. Availability is certainly one and security is another. Consider what you know of the company from the scenario, and think of other outcomes they may also want; then make sure your report addresses how your recommendations will help with achieving those outcomes.

<h2>Grade and Feedback </h2>
After submitting my assignment I recieved a 97% with this feedback :
"Overall, the touchstone was well done. The paper did an excellent job communicating the subnet strategy and the network's printing setup. Points were deducted because the WiFi network diagram was missing. For more information about the score, please see the graded rubric. "      -Aalok
